# cloud-pak-deployer-storage-fusion

This repo is using [Cloud pak deployer](https://ibm.github.io/cloud-pak-deployer).

This repo has two purposes:
1. Build the Cloud pak deployed in Openshift making it available to deploying Cloud paks.
2. Containing the configuration that will be used by the Cloud pak deployer

## Instructions

1. Fork this repo if you want to change the configuration in /config. Make sure to update the [URL to the git repo](https://github.com/thomas-mattsson/cloud-pak-deployer-gitops/blob/main/resources/resources.yaml#L7) if doing so.
2. If forked, update the configuration files in /config to match the wanted environment. See details in the cloud pak deployer instructions.
3. Run the following commands to build cloud pak deployer
```bash
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomas-mattsson/cloud-pak-deployer-gitops/main/resources/build.yaml
```
4. Add your entitlement key in a secret using the following command. You will need to insert your IBM entitlement registry key where indicated.
```bash
oc create secret generic cloud-pak-deployer-input -n cloud-pak-deployer --from-literal entitlement-key="<your entitlement key>"
```
5. Wait until the build from step 3 is finished. You can track it in the Builds/Builds section in the Openshift console.
6. Run the following command to start the deployment job using the configuration from the `config` directory.
```bash
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomas-mattsson/cloud-pak-deployer-gitops/main/resources/resources.yaml
```

Logs can be followed with
